O(1) O(n) O(n^2) O(log n)

Time Complexity: refers to the time used
e.g. iterating several times a data structure increases the execution time.
Space Complexity: refers to the memnory complexity.
e.g. using auxiliary data structures increases space(memory) consumption.


TIME COMPLEXITY
The overall time complexity of the function is dominated
by the loop that swaps the elements.

O(n)
This means we iterate only once

O(n^2)
This means we iterate once for each element


SPACE COMPLEXITY

O(1)
The function uses a constant amount of extra space for variables
and does not allocate additional space proportional to the input size
