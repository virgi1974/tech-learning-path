Permutations and Factorial
[1,2,3]
3 elements -> 3! = 3 * 2 * 1 = 6 permutations
123 132 213 231 312 321

Set {1,2,3} is a subSet of {1,2,3,4}

Arithmetic sequence
sequence of numbers such that the difference between the consecutive terms is constant.
1 2 3 4 5

Sum of an arithmetic sequence
(first_element + last_element) * number_of_elements / 2
sum([1,2,3,4,5]) = (1 + 5) * 5 / 2 = 15

Geometric sequence
a sequence of numbers such that the ratio between the consecutive terms is constant.
1 2 4 8 16 (ratio = 2)

Modular Arithmetic
function mod(x, y) {
  while (x >= y) {
    x -= y
  }
  return x
}

useful for checking if a number is divisible by another number
e.g. prime numbers
The general solution to this classical problem is to check if n is divisible by any integers in the range [2, sqrt(n)]
It works because if a number has more than 2 divisors, it will always have a divisor in the range [2, sqrt(n)].

  Example 1: n = 15
  We have 15 % 2 = 1 and 15 % 3 = 0. Since 15 % 3 == 0, 15 isn't prime

  Example 2: n = 17
  We have 17 % 2 = 1, 17 % 3 = 2, and 17 % 4 = 1. Since none of these values evaluated to 0, we can conclude 17 is prime.
