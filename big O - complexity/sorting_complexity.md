Why Sorting Takes 𝑂(𝑛log𝑛)
O(nlogn):
Comparison-Based Sorting Algorithms:

The most commonly used sorting algorithms, such as Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Heap Sort, are comparison-based sorting algorithms.
In these algorithms, elements are compared to each other to determine their order.
It has been proven that any comparison-based sorting algorithm requires at least 𝑂(𝑛log𝑛)
O(nlogn) comparisons in the worst case to sort an array of
𝑛
n elements. This is a lower bound for the time complexity of comparison-based sorting algorithms.
Explanation of 𝑂(𝑛log𝑛)
O(nlogn):

The term
𝑛
n represents the number of elements in the array. It indicates that each element needs to be "touched" or processed at least once during sorting.
The term
log
⁡
𝑛
logn arises from the way the problem is divided in sorting algorithms like Merge Sort or Quick Sort. These algorithms typically follow a "divide and conquer" approach:
The array is repeatedly divided into smaller sub-arrays (halved), which requires
log
⁡
𝑛
logn levels of division.
At each level of division, all
𝑛
n elements need to be compared or processed.
